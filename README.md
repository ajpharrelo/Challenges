# Challenges
This repository contains a collection of programming challenges I have completed using the C language.

These challenges are from a book my college tutor gave to me which I completely
forgot about, but I think completing them all would be a great way to develop my C
knowledge.

There are a total of **27** programming challenges, which increase in difficulty as I will progress them.

I will attempt to complete them all, while documenting how I completed them.

## Challenge 1 - Tell a joke
This challenge is probably one the many simple ones which just requires 
printing out a string waiting for input and then printing another string.

## Challenge 2 - Output a name
Again another simple challenge which only required basic input
and then printing out the input

## Challenge 3 - Calculate area of rectangle
This challenge simply completed by requesting a width and a height and
multiplying them.
