# Challenges
This repository contains a collection of programming challenges I have completed using the C language.

These challenges are from a book my college tutor gave to me which I completely
forgot about, but I think completing them all would be a great way to develop my C
knowledge.

There are a total of **27** programming challenges, which increase in difficulty as I will progress them.

I will attempt to complete them all, while documenting how I completed them.
